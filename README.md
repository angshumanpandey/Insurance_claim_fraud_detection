# Insurance_claim_fraud_detection
Insurance frauds cover the range of improper activities which an individual may commit in order to achieve a favorable outcome from the insurance company. This could range from staging the incident, misrepresenting the situation including the relevant actors and the cause of incident and finally the extent of damage caused.
Potential situations could include:
Covering-up for a situation that wasnâ€™t covered under insurance (e.g. drunk driving, performing risky acts, illegal activities etc.)
Misrepresenting the context of the incident: This could include transferring the blame to incidents where the insured party is to blame, failure to take agreed upon safety measures
Infiating the impact of the incident: Increasing the estimate of loss incurred either through addition of unrelated losses (faking losses) or attributing increased cost to the losses
The insurance industry has grappled with the challenge of insurance claim fraud from the very start. On one hand, there is the challenge of impact to customer satisfaction through delayed payouts or prolonged investigation during a period of stress. Additionally, there are costs of investigation and pressure from insurance industry regulators. On the other hand, improper payouts cause a hit to profitability and encourage similar delinquent behavior from other policy holders.
The main aim of the project is to build a detection models which helps to save insurance company to have loss from fraud reports.
